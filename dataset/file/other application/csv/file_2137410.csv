To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless they expressly state otherwise.

2. EULERBEATS ORIGINAL NFTS AND PRINT TOKENS
EulerBeats uses smart contracts stored on the Ethereum network to enable users to purchase certain unique non-fungible tokens (each, an “Original NFT”), each of which is linked to a unique, digital, audio-visual work generated by EulerBeats through the use of generative art technology (the “Artwork”). “Prints” of an Original NFT may also be created and purchased (each print, a “Print Token”).  As discussed below, different rights and terms apply to Original NFTs and Print Tokens.
The Bonding Curve
A unique bonding curve market is associated with each Original NFT, which governs all Print Tokens related to that Original NFT. The bonding curve market aggregates funds from sales of the relevant Print Tokens, allowing holders of a Print Token to  “burn” their Print Token in exchange for a portion of the funds held in the bonding curve pool applicable to that Print Token (the “Burn Reserve”). 
Bonding curves are nascent markets and technology, and EulerBeats makes no guarantee that any user will be able to use the bonding curve market to burn their asset at all – much less at any particular price. The “burn” price may be lower than the purchase price for the particular Print Token, depending on the specific bonding curve at the time the Print Token is “burned”. You acknowledge and accept the risk that there may be vulnerabilities and a risk of loss of funds.
Print Token Transaction Proceeds
When you create and purchase a Print Token, the proceeds of that transaction are allocated as follows:
EulerBeats Genesis Release
Burn Reserve : 90%
Original NFT Holder : 8%
EulerBeats :  2%


EulerBeats Enigma Release
Burn Reserve : 84%
Original NFT Holder : 8%
EulerBeats :  8%


Gas Fees
Ethereum requires a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) to be paid for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. This includes all transactions of Original NFTs and Print Tokens.  Gas Fees are consumed by the blockchain platform in processing your transaction and are not refundable.  You can read more about Gas Fees here.  
Third-Party Platform Fees
The purchase and sale of Original NFTs or Print Tokens on third-party marketplaces or platforms like OpenSea are subject to the terms and conditions of those marketplaces, which may include the collection of service fees and/or commissions.  For more information, please refer to the terms applicable to the third-party platform, which EulerBeats does not control.
Taxes and Duties
You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your use of the Website, and/or payable as the result of your purchase, ownership, sale, transfer, use and/or exploitation of any Original NFT, Print Token, and/or Artwork. 
Ownership; Artwork License – Original NFTs
You own the Original NFT.  If you purchase an Original NFT, you will own that Original NFT. As an owner of an Original NFT, you may sell your Original NFT.  As an owner of an Original NFT, you consent to the unlimited creation, purchase, and use of Print Tokens based on your Original NFT as described below. 
You hold a broad exclusive license to the Artwork.  When you purchase an Original NFT, and so long as you retain ownership of that Original NFT, you will hold an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to the Artwork, subject only to the following limitations:
* You may not use the Artwork to create a new NFT, token or other digital asset that is a replica or is substantially similar to the Artwork; however, you may create derivative works based on the Artwork, and are free to use those derivatives to create new NFTs, tokens or other digital assets as long as they are new creative works and are not replicas of or substantially similar to the Artwork;

* You may not use the Artwork in any manner as prohibited by the “Restrictions” set forth in Section 4 below. 
Ownership; Limited Artwork License – Print Tokens 


You own the Print Token.  If you purchase a Print Token, you will own that Print Token. As an owner of a Print Token, you may sell or burn your Print Token.


You hold a limited license to the Artwork.  When you purchase a Print Token, you will hold a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable, royalty-free license to use the Artwork in connection with the Print Token only (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) in connection with the marketing, promotion, and/or sale of the Print Token as permitted herein.

15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.  IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
Agreement to Arbitrate 
You and EulerBeats agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between us arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Website, Original NFTs, Print Tokens, or Artwork, as well as any smart contracts and/or scripts related thereto, (“Disputes”) will be resolved through binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court (a “Small Claims Action”) and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in New York County and EulerBeats and you waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts and consent to their jurisdiction. You agree you may bring arbitration claims only on your own behalf and not on behalf of any other person or entity.
Unless you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the subsection titled “Your Choices”), you acknowledge and agree that you and EulerBeats are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and EulerBeats otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.  
This clause does not limit either party’s ability to file an action in a court with jurisdiction to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for disputes relating to intellectual property, proprietary data, or to enforce this dispute resolution clause, including your agreement not to assert claims related to the suspension or termination of another person’s account. In any such action, the court rather than an arbitrator must decide whether such a claim is arbitrable and must decide whether the party is entitled to the requested injunctive or other equitable relief.
Arbitration Rules
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section. (The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/mediation or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute Resolution Section.
Arbitration Process
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Arbitration Location and Procedure
Unless you and EulerBeats otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the state where you reside, with the option for you to participate telephonically to the extent the AAA Rules allow. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and EulerBeats submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Arbitrator’s Decision
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions which the arbitrator based its award on. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the arbitration award. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” subsection of these Terms as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. EulerBeats will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration, unless such arbitration is found by the arbitrator to be frivolous under the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b) and in that case EulerBeats shall be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees in addition to any damages awarded to it.
Fees
If the arbitrator finds that your payment of the administrative and arbitrator fees (excluding any attorney’s fees) under this subsection is a burden on you, we agree to pay those fees for you (but not any attorney’s fees). 
Changes
By rejecting any changes to these Terms, you agree that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and EulerBeats in accordance with the provisions of this Section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
Your Choices
If you do not want to settle Disputes by arbitration as described above, you will notify us by sending us written notice (including by email to info@treum.io) telling us that you do not want to use arbitration, within thirty (30) days of the date on which you agreed to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you do not provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except for a Small Claims Action and an IP Protection Action as stated above.
Investigations
We reserve the right to investigate and prosecute any suspected breaches of these Terms or the Website. We may disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.
16. WAIVER OF INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF 
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND, SUCH AS ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSIONS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY EULERBEATS OR A LICENSOR OF EULERBEATS.
